CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (Find_Package):
  By not providing "FindCholmod.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Cholmod", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Cholmod" with any
  of the following names:

    CholmodConfig.cmake
    cholmod-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Cholmod" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Cholmod_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "Cholmod" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
